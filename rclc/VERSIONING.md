Versioning policy declaration
=============================

Starting with version 1.0.0, the version numbers for this package will adhere to the versioning policies defined by [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

This means that API breaks should only happen between major version changes.
If an ABI break is required, it should be done between minor versions, and it should be clearly stated in the release notes.

The changes included in each version can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/ros2/rclc/releases)
