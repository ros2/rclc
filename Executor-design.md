# Notice
In this feature branch (feature/restructured-executor), a new modular rclc-Executor is developed. It will provide the following functionality:

- single-threaded Executor
- multi-threaded Executor
- AUTOSAR-like Executor (for periodic operating systems)


# Software Design

- one base rclc package with single-threaded Executor
- several packages for additional configurations (multi-threaded, AUTOSAR-like OS)
- one configuration function, ...
- each method in rclc library has a function pointer to specialization 
- this fn-pointer is set in the configuration function


# Comparison of Executor Implementation

This table gives an overview of the differences between the Executor implementations. 
Each function in the rclc-library might have a function pointer to a specialization function, e.g. work that is specific to the particular Executor. 

| Function name                  | Single-threaded | Multi-threaded | AUTOSAR-like |
